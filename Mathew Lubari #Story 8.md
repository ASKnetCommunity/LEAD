My name is Mathew Lubari, I am a South Sudanese leaving in Uganda as a refugee, this happened in 2016 when political instability broke out between the Spla/Io under the leadership of Dr. Riek machar and the Spla government under the leadership of president kir. this has forced me and my family to come to Uganda where each of us took a different direction in order to save our lives. But while in Uganda i got an opportunity to work with one organization called RMF and ACF as a volunteer before i joined the organization of my dream which is community technology empowerment network(CTEN) where i am currently working as an ICT Assistant. working with CTEN has given me great opportunities like trainings and Networking with others. One of it was the ASKNet training which was conducted by r0g agency in 2018 where i was able to learn how to build a solar charger using the available resources. during the training i worked all the night making a portable solar charger which took me about 7hrs where i succeeded in making.
