    My name is wafela Andrew,humble 
social,approachable,flexible,easy to 
approach and eager to  learn and share 
ideas with the communities for 
prosperity.
     Am a born of  Oct/9/1986,of amother 
called Wanyenya billah and the father 
know as Arita yassin.
     I hope this answers the question people 
might have been asking his name is 
Andrew but a Muslim, right my mother is 
a christian from mbale busiu sub county.
     I was born in Sudan  in yei,but because of the continuous rebel activities by 
then ,my dad send us back to Uganda,but 
Uganda was not stable though they had 
just attained independence,that was in  
1988,due to the rebel activities which 
were still prevailing in the westnile 
region.
     Taking all that in account,my mother 
decided to leave with us to there 
place,mbale busiu subcounty.
     We were five in number ,two boys and 
three girls ,my dady gave me aname 
Chad,and i was the fourth born of the 
familly, the first was Angoliga,second 
Salama,third Bako fifth Night.On our 
arrival to my mummy's place 
people welcomed us we tears,mourning 
as if someone just died.
      But never the less it was because she went missing 
for years and came back when they had 
already concluded that maybe she was abducted by Joseph konyi 
and his rebels,
      Thereafter bulls were slaughtered,people celebrated,most of 
them expecting my father to follow as in 
the near future.
      However by then communication was 
very poor ,the only means of 
communication was writing a letter 
through Uganda red cross ,so we 
suffered the difficulty of 
communicating to my father's side.
      My mother started teaching me from 
home ,untill i was 12yrs old when i 
joined school.
      Mummy was so loving and open to us 
,as in ,she could narrate for us the 
difficulties she faced during war 
times,she encouraged us on how to face 
hard times in life.
      I joined my primary one in 1998,and in 
1999 in primary three,2000 in primary 
four,2001 in primary five,2002 primary 
six and sat my primary seven and 
obtained aggregate eight
       When I brought the results home my m 
other bursted into tears,because of good 
results and no one was there to support 
me in my secondary.l told her to hold 
her tears and told her that God doesn't 
forget his people,she inturn urged me to 
be obidient and friendly to any 
community and focus much on practical 
things,she again revealed to me that when doing something ,i shouldn'r 
concentrate too much on money as an 
outcome,expressing that knowledge is wealth,she further told me that in whatever u do put God first ,your 
success will be automatic.
       Knowing very well,and remembering wat she went through in the past she taught me how to do any work,by then there were no characterisation of work like 
this is for girls or boys,I could do any 
work.
       Though we used to do some peasant 
farming,this wasn't enough to support 
my secondary education,she has one her 
brothers operating abig electronic 
garage ,she pleaded with him that he 
should teach me ,since I was active 
enough and obidient because of the 
comments given the community around 
my uncle gave afull access to the 
workshop.
        However i attended it for just 
amonth,one of my aunts who was in 
international university in uganda (IUIU) 
came looking for mother,with the 
information that one of her friends at 
the university is looking for his late 
brother's wife who left with five children Whose names are chad,knight 
bako,salama and angoliga,my aunt didnt 
know because we were given different 
names by our maternal uncles.
       When she took the information back to 
him ,he came and my mother could 
remember  him verywell ,happiness was 
making me shed tears,because other 
members of the community were 
abusing of being fatherless but got a 
representative from my father's side.
        I immediately picked my results to him 
and he decided to call the brother, and  I 
was brought along to adjumani,taken to 
st Charles lwanga but again my uncle 
couldn't manage  to pay my tution in 
time,i suggested him to  enroll me in 
acheap school where he would manage 
to pay my fees in time ,such that  my 
performance doesn't decline because of 
late school fees payments ,
        But he pushed me up to senior six
whereby he lost his job and I was not 
able to push any institution or unversity.
Since while in school during holidays, I 
could join my uncle  for skills in repair,he 
was so nice and encouraging ,and after 
    Four months later,I was able to start my own garage. 
    Ihave been doing my things offline for 
20yrs now ,but what inspired me to 
community activities was one of my 
friends Mr vuga William who offered me 
a chance to access #Askotec trainings 
as a trainer for several times at 
pagirinya refugee camp where we were 
able to empower the young people in 
that community with skills and 
knowledge .
    This is where i learnt how interesting sharing 
knowledge with community is 
advantageous, as in you get expose to 
new people,gain knowledge because in 
#Ascotek we do things  jointly in the 
way that the owner of the device  is 
taught how to fix items on their own 
   And besides that we gain more knowledge since a great number of collaborators are involved.
   The big bang so interesting was of 
recent in 2019 repair cafe organised by 
YEF, at ruyo guest house in adjumani 
which was so inspiring ,skills learnt 
,friendship created etc.
   Therefore doing together with the  
community is more more of exposure to 
knowledge and skills than doing things 
with selfishness,
    However due to the knowledge acquired from #Askotek,
I was able to build an FM transmitter ,to the level of
giving sound,had it been not because #Askotek culture i wouldn't
have made it regards to mr maliamungu richard
Who mentored me during the 2019 training held,
at YEF,about building led light.
          Long live open tool collaboration 2020-2021.
